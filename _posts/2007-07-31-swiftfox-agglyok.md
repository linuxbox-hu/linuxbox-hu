A http://getswiftfox.org/ -ot bukkantam az alábbi szövegre:

Don't get Swiftfox!

Swiftfox is supposed to be a processor-optimized build of Firefox. It probably is exactly what it claims to be, but nobody can really be sure. Why? Because the author refuses to release all his changes to the Firefox code base. Furthermore, he refuses to allow redistribution of his binary builds.

The Mozilla Public License clearly allows developers to release their own executables under a more restrictive license. However, when they do so they are required to release ALL source code changes under the MPL, GPL, or the LGPL. The Swiftfox developer has not done this, and instead has released only a patch which does nothing but make changes to the default preferences in Firefox.

Why does he not allow redistribution of the binaries? Because he claims that Swiftfox is more secure this way. Swiftfox would be more secure if, and only if, the developer would fully comply with the MPL, GPL, or LGPL.
Don't get Swiftfox!

At least until the "developer" starts playing nice with the Open Source community and answers the following questions:

# Why do you refuse to release ALL your source code changes, and instead release only a patch file?
# Why isn't your patch file licensed under the MPL, as the MPL requires it to be?
# Why do you refuse to discuss this on your forum system, and in fact ban those who question or confront you on this topic?
# Why should we trust the binaries of a man who does any of the above?
